# Vida front end exercise

#### A brief story of this web application

This is the very first web app that I had ever did in AngularJS.

It was done during my **7 and a half long interview** with my actual company Vida, the *9th March 2017*. It took me about 4 hours and a half to complete it. I did it that day when they let me do it at their offices after a quick introduction of the company by the CTO and a brief of my previous job experiencies.

Basically during that hours I studied quickly the very basic AngularJS statements to complete the application, that for these resons it is not very standardized.

It was later reviewed with the CTO, whom I explained the decisions that I made in terms of coding style and layouts. 

*This exercise was the exercise that gave me the job and the opportunity to improve further my knowledge with AngularJS!*

#### The story continues because I got the job!

In this company I am actually building from scratch a new platform using more reasonable AngularJS stardards that are commonly used around.

Indeed in this exercise **there is no coding style neither a folder structure neither other AngularJS common standards** (remember that this was my first ever single page app done using Angular).

All the functionalities for this app are inside one controller that consumes Vida's APIs.

The flux is pretty much all procedural that start with a very basic login that, if successful, shows a list of clients in a HTML table. With the `More Details` links, all the client's details can be seen.

###### Build the app to make it work

- Run `npm install` or another package manager like `yarn`.
- Start the server with `node server`.
- Then run `gulp` to build the code: this will create the `dist` folder.
- Open `localhost:9010` to see the app working.
