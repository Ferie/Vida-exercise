# Vida front end exercise

This is the very first web app that I had ever did in AngularJS.

It was done during my 7 and a half long interview with my actual company Vida.

**There is no coding style neither some folder structure** (remember that this was my first ever single page app done using Angular).

It is all procedural function that follow a very basic login and shows a list of clients. If you click on the "More Details" links you can view more information about the single client.
