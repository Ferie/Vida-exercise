# Vida front end exercise

This is the very first web app that I had ever did in AngularJS.

It was done during my **7 and a half long interview** with my actual company Vida, the *9th March 2017*. It took me about 4 hours and a half to complete it. I did it that day when they let me do it at their offices after.

It was later reviewed with the CTO explaining the decisions made and how quickly I had studied the very basic AngularJS statements.

This exercise was the exercise that gave me the job and the opportunity to improve further my knowledge in AngularJS.

In this company I am actually building from scratch a new platform using more reasonable AngularJS stardards that are commonly used around.

Indeed in this exercise **there is no coding style neither some folder structure neither AngularJS standard** (remember that this was my first ever single page app done using Angular).

All the app is inside in only one controller that consumes Vida's APIs.

The flux is pretty much all procedural that start with a very basic login that, if successful, shows a list of clients in a HTML table. With the `More Details` links, all the client's details can be seen.
